    // These ampersands are references, and they allow you to refer to some value without taking
    // ownership of it.
    let len = calculate_length(&hello_str);

    // Note: The opposite of referencing by using & is dereferencing, which is accomplished with

    // We call having references as function parameters 'borrowing'.
    // So what happens if we try to modify something weâ€™re borrowing? It doesnâ€™t work!

    // We can fix the error with just a small tweak:

    // First, we had to change s to be mut. Then we had to create a mutable reference with &mut s
    // and accept a mutable reference with some_string: &mut String.

    // But mutable references have one big restriction: you can have only one mutable reference to
    // a particular piece of data in a particular scope. This code will fail:
    let mut s = String::from("hello");
    let r1 = &mut s;
    // let r2 = &mut s; // error[E0499]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable more than once at a time
    println!("r1 = {}", r1);

    // The benefit of having this restriction is that Rust can prevent data races at compile time:
    // * Two or more pointers access the same data at the same time.
    // * At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data.
    // * Thereâ€™s no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data.

    // We can use curly brackets to create a new scope, allowing for multiple mutable references,
    // just not simultaneous ones:
    let mut s2 = String::from("hello");
    {
        let r1 = &mut s2;

    let r4 = &s3; // no problem
    // Compile error[E0502]: cannot borrow `s3` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
