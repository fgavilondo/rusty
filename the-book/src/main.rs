    // The Rules of References:
    // * At any given time, you can have either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.
    // * References must always be valid.


    // The issue with the calculate_length_moved() function is that we have to return the String to
    // the calling function so we can still use the String after the call to calculate_length,
    // because the String was moved into calculate_length.
    // Here is how you would define and use a calculate_length function that has a reference to an
    // object as a parameter instead of taking ownership of the value:
    let hello_str = String::from("hello");
    // These ampersands are references, and they allow you to refer to some value without taking
    // ownership of it.
    let len = calculate_length(&hello_str);
    println!("The length of '{}' is {}.", hello_str, len);

    // Note: The opposite of referencing by using & is dereferencing, which is accomplished with
    // the dereference operator, *. (Chapter 15)

    // We call having references as function parameters 'borrowing'.
    // So what happens if we try to modify something weâ€™re borrowing? It doesnâ€™t work!
    change_borrowed(&hello_str);

    // We can fix the error with just a small tweak:
    let mut hello_mut = String::from("hello");
    change_borrowed_mutable(&mut hello_mut);
    // First, we had to change s to be mut. Then we had to create a mutable reference with &mut s
    // and accept a mutable reference with some_string: &mut String.

    // But mutable references have one big restriction: you can have only one mutable reference to
    // a particular piece of data in a particular scope. This code will fail:
    let mut s = String::from("hello");
    let r1 = &mut s;
    // let r2 = &mut s; // error[E0499]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable more than once at a time
    println!("r1 = {}", r1);

    // The benefit of having this restriction is that Rust can prevent data races at compile time:
    // * Two or more pointers access the same data at the same time.
    // * At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data.
    // * Thereâ€™s no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data.

    // We can use curly brackets to create a new scope, allowing for multiple mutable references,
    // just not simultaneous ones:
    let mut s2 = String::from("hello");
    {
        let r1 = &mut s2;

    let r4 = &s3; // no problem
